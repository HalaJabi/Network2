# Network2

I developed a series of web pages and a client application to manage SNMP data using both PHP and Java. You'll use XAMPP or WAMP and Tomcat Apache servers. The project is divided into two parts:

Part 1 (PHP): Develop PHP pages to display and edit SNMP data. Create pages for system group info, TCP table, ARP table, and SNMP group statistics, with appropriate navigation.
Part 2 (Java): Develop a Java client application, servlet, and JSP page for user authentication. The client will communicate with the servlet and JSP for authentication and then retrieve SNMP data from the PHP server if authentication is successful.
